Par2vel
-------

Par2vel is a python toolbox for doing Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). 
It is aimed for research and education. It is not as fast as commercial 
codes, but it should be easy to do your own design of processing. Since 
it is a toolbox, you will need to have some basic knowledge of the Python 
language. If you look at a few examples, you will probably get the idea. 
So - the user interface is using a python script or command prompt. There 
are no menu or windows.

The present version is only capable of basic two-component PIV and is 
under development for stereoscopic PIV.

The toolbox is open source under GNU General Public License version 3, 
and you are very welcome to contribute to the code.

The main developer of the code is:

|Department of Mechanical Engineering
|Technical University of Denmark
