   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to par2vel's documentation!
===================================

Par2vel is a python toolbox for doing Particle Image Velocimetry
(PIV). It is aimed for research and education. It might not be as fast
as commercial codes, but it should be easy to do your own design of
processing. Since it is a toolbox, you will need to have some basic
knowledge of the Python script language. If you look at a few
examples, you will probably get the idea. So - the user interface is
using a python script or command prompt. There are no menu or windows.
