Welcome to par2vel's documentation!
===================================

Par2vel is a python toolbox for doing Particle Image Velocimetry
(PIV). The name indicates that it supports methods where images of
tracer **par**\ ticles are used to to estimate fluid **vel**\ ocities. 
It is aimed for research and education. It is not as fast
as commercial codes, but it should be easy to do your own design of
processing. Since it is a toolbox, you will need to have some basic
knowledge of the Python script language. If you look at a few
examples, you will probably get the idea. The user interface a
simple python script or command prompt.
